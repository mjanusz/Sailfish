This is an experimental branch with support for multi-GPU simulations.
Once stabilized and fully developed, this code will replace the main
Sailfish branch.

Many features are missing or broken in the multigpu branch.  Use it
for development and exploration only, do NOT run any production
simulations using this code unless you know excetly what you are doing.

Please note that the code has not been optimized for speed yet.

If you want to help, please e-mail sailfish-cfd@googlegroups.com.
