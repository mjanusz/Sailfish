Note that you don't need to be a physicist or engineer to be able to provide useful help.
We have a number of things that we would like to do within the project that only
require basic programming skills but which would nevertheless be very helpful to us.
If you want to help but are not sure how, please contact us on the *sailfish-cfd*
mailing list.
